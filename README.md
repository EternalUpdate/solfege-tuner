# solfege-tuner
This is a tuner web app that attempts to show the solfege syllable that is played / sung in real-time, corresponding to a user-chosen scale.

It's based on the YIN pitch detection algorithm using the [pitchfinder.js](https://github.com/peterkhayes/pitchfinder) library.

`solfege-tuner` is implemented in Typescript using the React framework and Vite.js.

This is meant as an educational tool.

## Installation
`npm install` the dependencies, and `npm run dev`.
